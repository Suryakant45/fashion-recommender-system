# fashion-recommender-system
Developed a deep learning-based fashion recommendation system that suggests visually similar clothing items based on user-uploaded images. Utilized a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction from fashion images, generating 2048-dimensional embeddings. Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to identify and recommend the top 5 visually similar items from the dataset. This project showcases the application of computer vision techniques in enhancing user experience within e-commerce platforms.
